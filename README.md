- The first parameter should be the weight(Kg) and the second should be the height(M).
- NOTE: You do not need to write any alerts or prompts or console logs. Your code should only contain the function, the result has to be returned by the function. You do not need to call the function.

- IMPORTANT: The solution checker is expecting an array as the correct output.
- You do NOT need any alerts or prompts, the result should be returned from the function as an output.
- The first two numbers in the sequence must be 0 and 1.
